**Description**
> Developed and open-sourced a comprehensive Cloud Security Range consisting of high-fidelity, real-world inspired CTF challenges.
>
> **Key Contributions:**
> *   **Custom CLI Tool:** Engineered `awsctf`, a portable CLI tool written in **Go** to automate the lifecycle (deploy/destroy) of complex cloud environments using Terraform.
> *   **Advanced Scenarios:** Designed "Insane" difficulty attack chains (e.g., *CloudStrike: GoDeep*) simulating LFI, Log Poisoning, IAM Privilege Escalation, and Container Escapes.
> *   **Infrastructure as Code:** Utilized Terraform and Docker to programmatically deploy vulnerable infrastructure involving EC2, ECR, Load Balancers, and S3.
> *   **Cross-Platform Distribution:** Implemented installation support for Homebrew (macOS/Linux) and binary releases.

**Headline:**
🚀 **Launching AWSCTF: A Real-World Cloud Security Range & CLI Tool**

**Body:**
I’m excited to share my latest open-source project: **AWSCTF**.

Bridging the gap between theory and practice in Cloud Security is a challenge. To solve this, I built a collection of high-fidelity, "Red Team" inspired scenarios that deploy directly into your own AWS account—giving you a safe, legal, and realistic environment to practice advanced exploitation techniques.

To make the experience seamless, I also developed a custom CLI tool in **Go** 🐹.

**🔥 What's Inside:**
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Every scenario is defined in Terraform and Docker.
*   **One-Command Deployment:** The `awsctf` CLI handles all the heavy lifting to spin up (and tear down) complex labs instantly.
*   **Real Attack Paths:**
    *   🛡️ **CloudStrike: GoDeep:** A multi-stage attack involving LFI, Log Poisoning, and IAM Pivoting.
    *   🐳 **Container Escape:** Breaking out of isolated containers within AWS.
    *   🌶️ **SSRF & RCE chains:** Exploiting classic web vulnerabilities in cloud-native apps.

Building this project pushed me to dive deeper into **#Golang**, **#Terraform**, and the nuances of **#AWS** IAM and network security.

It's fully open-source. Check it out, break things, and let me know what you think!
